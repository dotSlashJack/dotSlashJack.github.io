        <div id="whyContent" class="aboutContent styleIndent" style="display: block;">
            Due to countless surgeries and doctors office visits, I've been personally immersed in the health care system from the day I was born. I would constantly imagine ways that the health care system could be improved, from better equipment to cures for diseases
            to improved physician-patient interactions. My motivation to improve health care--and more fundamentally improve peoples' quality of life--has been at the core of everything I've done. Eventually, I landed in public health in order to work
            on this goal.
        </div>
        <div id="howContent" class="aboutContent styleIndent">
            In order to accomplish my goals of improving public health and more generally quality of life, I blend technology with health care. I've worked in several domains including computational and biological modeling, natural language processing, web development,
            data visualization, designing and implementing public health interventions, and education. I'm also in my second year of an MPH at Brown University. By combining concepts from these and other fields, I work to improve the health care system.
        </div>
        <div id="whatContent" class="aboutContent styleIndent">
            I work on a variety of health care problems, including work on technological and privacy-preserving solutions for COVID-19 as well as local government response to COVID-19, the loneliness epidemic, disease modeling and prediction, and identifying drug
            side effects using NLP. I also have a passion for educating people at all stages of life, and I've worked on mathematical visualizations and am currently teaching a research course at Brown University.

                        <li>How much access to health care records should patients have? How do we keep them secure and disperse them (using EmTech i.e. blockchain)?</li>
