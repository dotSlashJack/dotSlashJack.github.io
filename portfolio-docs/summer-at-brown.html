            <h2>Teaching: Research Methods</h2>
            <p>I designed and taught a new course, for the Brown University Summer@Brown program. The course, entitled "From Idea to Publication: Building Your Own Research Project," stepped students through the basics of research. Course content included systematic
                reviews and citations, basic statistics and hypothesis testing, data visualization and presentation, academic writing standards with a focus on evidence-based research methods, and evidence synthesis techniques. Every student picked a desired publication and wrote a paper that would be published in that kind of journal or other medium. I taught the class online
                for six weeks and supervised a teaching assistant. The class size was 20 students ranging from high school to first year of college. I will be teaching this course again in summer of 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this experience, I learned about several aspects of teaching including course development, effectively communicating with students and administrators, designing and grading assignments and assessments, and managing a TA.
