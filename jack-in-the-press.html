                Cameo:<br> <div style="font-style: italic;">"A native of the Reno-Tahoe region, Jack Hester loves to ski and is a committed coffee aficionado. He takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring public health and its intersection with technology, with a special eye towards data visualization and mechanism design. Jack’s senior thesis, “Mining Adverse Drug Side Effects from Online Forum Posts,” uses computational linguistics methods to analyze patient posts on healthcare forums in order to predict previously undiscovered prescription drug side effects. He is excited by the project’s contributions to healthcare and linguistics and hopes his findings will improve or even save the lives of prescription drug users in the future."</div><br>

            Cameo:<br> <div style="font-style: italic;">"Jack Hester 19C was a student in the class and identifies as someone with a disability—in his case a series of physical issues that include a short right leg and scoliosis. He wasn’t quite sure what to expect from the class and was pleasantly surprised. “This class reaffirmed my interest in examining topics in medicine, especially about disabilities, from a humanities-based perspective,” he says."</div><br>
