      <p style="text-align: left;">by Kryn Dykema</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Kryn will follow the development of Emory's Carbon Offset Program and analyze the process to recommend a plan of best practice for this type of implementation. With this focus he will suggest the most effective fundraising strategy for a university, drawing from study of behavioral economics; he will calculate the most comprehensive greenhouse gas metric, from research on emissions factors in aviation, and he will find the most realized offset protocol, given the scholarship of climate science. With this Kryn aims to draft a manual and record of my work with Emory's Office of Sustainability.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">A Drawdown Approach to Food Sustainability at Emory: Putting Plant-based foods at the Center of the Plate</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">by Isaac Goldman</p>
      <p style="text-align: left">Isaac's thesis outlines that plant-based foods require fewer greenhouse gases to produce than meat and animal-based foods. By proving this fact, he argues that through the introduction of more plant-based foods on the menus of Emory’s dining halls, the university will be able to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the food it purchases. He analyzes the results of a series of tests of plant-based products in Emory dining halls, which provided data on which plant-based products are most appealing to students and therefore, which plant-based foods students are most likely to substitute in place of meat-based foods. By modeling and projecting the greenhouse gases associated with Emory’s food, he is able to see whether or not the plant-based foods tests were effective in decreasing Emory’s food-related GHGs, he is able to track GHG reductions in the DUCling from 2017-2018 to 2018-2019, and he can project future GHG emissions reduction if the DUCling decreases meat purchasing by 25% and 50%, respectively. From the results of the plant-based foods tests as well as the GHG modeling, Isaac will propose a plan, with tangible steps and programs, for Emory and other universities to decrease their food-related GHG emissions in the future.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">by Jack Hester</p>
      <p style="text-align: left">Jack’s senior thesis, "Mining Adverse Drug Effects from Online Forum Posts," uses computational linguistics methods to analyze patient posts on healthcare forums in order to predict previously undiscovered prescription drug side-effects. He also examines the overall severities of both newer and older drug side-effects, and uncovers overall patient sentiments about the drugs. Jack hopes his findings will improve or even save the lives of prescription drug users in the future.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">The Locus of Control of Undergraduate Business Students</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">by Olivia Fogel</p>
      <p style="text-align: left">Locus of control (LOC) is one of the most popular personality variables in psychology. It originated from Rotter’s social learning theory and is defined as a generalized problem solving expectancy (Rotter, 1966). LOC measures how much individuals expect their outcomes to be determined by their behavior.  Generally, scholars find that the greater the expectancy behavior has an effect, the more positive the outcomes (Nowicki & Duke, 2016). Locus of control has been associated with many outcomes. However, few studies have focused on determining the LOC of specific undergraduate majors; in this case business school students. This study was conducted at a private, mid-sized Southeastern undergraduate business school. Students (n = 414) completed Nowicki-Strickland LOC scales upon entering the business school, in either their fourth or fifth semester. Males who entered business school in their fourth semester were more internal than their female peers (F = 9.78, M = 8.74, p = 0.09). Male students who entered in their fourth semester were more internal than male students who entered in their fifth semester (Mfourth =8.74, Mfifth =9.23, p = 0.04). The findings suggest that males who entered business school earlier were more internal than their female early appliers and males who entered later. These findings suggest that it might be important to examine why time of entry into the business school varies by LOC and what that might mean for the overall success of the undergraduate program. If research finds support for a predicted relationship between LOC and performance, in terms of academic success, job acquisition, graduate school acceptance, awards and the like then future studies should focus on (1) how internals gain their advantage and (2) how to help students in the business school become more internal.</p>
