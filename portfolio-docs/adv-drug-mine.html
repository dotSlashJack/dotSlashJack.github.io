            <h2>Mining Drug Side Effects</h2>
            <p>
                For my senior thesis at Emory University, I used a combination of computational linguistics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods to discover and report dangerous prescription drug side effects from online health care forums.

                Adverse drug side-effects result in countless deaths and injuries each year and result in substantial medical costs and waste. The tool developed was mean to augment the FDA's post-clinical trial monitoring methods, which often miss many side effects, especially if doctors do not report them. 
                For the thesis project, I developed a model to identify side effects from health care forum text. Forum posts were automatically parsed and likely side-effects were extracted. A handful of severe side-effects were identified that were not listed in the FDA database (FEARS).

                To complete this thesis, I had to learn how to tie together apply NLP software, large data sets I downloaded, and machine learning models I had to develop and train. Beyond acquiring new technical skills, I also learned about the research and research writing process as well as how to manage large, long-term projects.
