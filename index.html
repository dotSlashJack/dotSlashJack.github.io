                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Jack, a senior at Emory University finishing a BA in public health and behavioral modeling. I study the healthacre system from an interdisciplinary perspective. My studies have taken me on a journey through the fields healthcare, sociology, biology, linguistics, quantitive sciences, computer science and computational modeling, physics, research and writing, and classical literature. I do public health, but that's only the beginning as you'll see if you read the rest of this page.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to countless surgeries and doctors office visits, I’ve been personally immersed in the healthcare system from the day I was born. I would constantly imagine ways that the healthcare system could be improved, from better equipment to cures for diseases to improved physician-patient interactions. My motivation to improve healthcare—and more fundamentally improve peoples’ quality of life—has been at the core of everything I’ve done. Eventually, I landed in public health in order to work on this goal.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned above, I’ve studied public health from a variety of perspectives including sociology, coding and emerging technology, biology, physics, behavioral modeling, computational linguistics, marketing and PR, and data visualization.
                        Even more critically, however, I like to ask lots of questions. Here are a few I’m currently working on, or am at least considering:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How much access to healthcare records should patients have? How do we keep them secure and disperse them (using EmTech i.e. blockchain)?</li>
                            <li>How can data be visualized to make it easier to understand for both patients and doctors?</li>
                            <li>Who are the major stakeholders in facilitating changes to the healthcare system? What are they motivated by? How can data be effectively communicated to them in a persuasive way?</li>
                            <li>How can healthcare record entry be simplified and/or sped up? How can it be automatically stored and processed to display insights about treatments over time?</li>
                            <li>How is the healthcare system being decentralized away from the current hospital-centric model? What impact does this have on healthcare accessibility and cost?</li>
                            <li>What is the return on investment for a given public health intervention? How is this determined? Who wants to know?</li>
                            <li>How can data be effectively generated and shared inside (and outside) the healthcare system (including public health departments, hosptials, inependent researchers, etc.)?</li>
                            <li>What are the major barriers to patients changing their behaviors towards healthier ones? How can geographic barriers be overcome?</li>
                            <li>Who are the biggest players in healthcare reform going to be? What is the role of private corporations going to look like?</li>
                            <li>What insights can behavioral economics provide to those working in healthcare? How about models from (unexpected?) fields like physics?</li>
                        </ul>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond asking lots of questions, ... As I mentioned above, I study and work primarily in public health. Even more fundamentally, I aim to understand people and how they behave so that I can improve foster healthier behaviors at every level of society. On this journey, I’ve gained skills in multiple fields to complement my core field. As a result, I blend technology and behavioral modeling with public health in an effort to better understand how to model the spread of diseases, people, technology, and ideas. By doing so, I strive to create meaningful improvements in behaviors and health outcomes. If you’re curious what kinds of projects I work on, I encourage you to look through the rest of my website [in progress] or <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.
