    <h1>Links to places where I say how to do some things I've had to do</h1>
    <p>
        There are so many times when I am like ooh this would be good information to have in the future because I'm going to need to do this again but then I don't want to bother writing it down and so because I didn't write it down then I forget and also when someone asks me how I did it I cannot remember so they also have to look. Maybe this collection of links will help you figure out how to do things that are the kinds of things I've needed to do but did not know how and took some googling and etc. because maybe you too are an academic or just want to do this anyway or because you need to. You can click on each link so much to learn how to do things (as long as I have actually done them correctly myself and the links are all working and all that so there is no warranty or whatever the lawyer people say).

    <p>Ok that is too much talking here are your links thank you</p>
