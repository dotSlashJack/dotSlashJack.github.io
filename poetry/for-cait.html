            She fell in love with<br />
            The eyes that changed their color<br />
            depending on the clothes she was wearing.<br />
            The hair that she cut herself<br />
            and that shone a shade of red more beautiful than any autumn leaves.<br />
            The voice that nobody could forget,<br />
            the one that said said "good morning" in the loveliest way.<br />
            The hands with the most elegant painted nails<br />
            that were waiting to be gently held as a reminder that everything was ok.<br /><br />

            She fell in love with<br />
            The quiet girl<br />
            who knew way more than she ever let on.<br />
            The busiest and most hard working person<br />
            who still made time every day to encourage those who needed it the most.<br />
            The sarcastic comments and "difficult" attitude<br />
            that made for the best tweets.<br />
            The heart that had been hurt over and over<br />
            but deserved a love greater than anything a person could ever provide.<br /><br />

            She fell in love with<br />
            herself.<br />
            <i>Or at least she will some day</i><br />
