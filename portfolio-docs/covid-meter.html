            <h2>Truckee Meadows COVID-19 Risk Meter</h2>
            <p>
                As a member of the City of Reno Public Health Emergency Advisory Board and member of the Metrics Subcommittee, my responsibilities include research, data analysis, and making recommendations to support the development of a COVID-19 risk meter based on public health and health care system metrics. This is accomplished through a collaborative process with other members of the subcommittee and then shared with the larger advisory board. I am also part of a small team responsible for web development, predictive modeling, Python code that updates the meter daily, and documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, I've learned how to communicate and collaborate with a diverse group of stakeholders including politicians, public health officials, health care workers, and other community leaders. I also learned more about the challenges when creating public messaging and how to generate and share visualizations and information that can be understood by a wide audience.
