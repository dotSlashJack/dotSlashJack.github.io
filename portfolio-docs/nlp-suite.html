            <h2>NLP Toolbox</h2>
            <p>
                Since January 2019, I have worked on a suite of natural language processing (NLP) tools with a professor from my undergraduate university. We began with a custom Python implementation of Stanford CoreNLP and a handful of corpus analysis tools. The original goal was to make NLP tools available to students and to conduct meaningful research, especially related to narrative, location, subject-verb-object (SVO), and shape-of-story analysis. Since then, we have added over 150 tools. Our software builds on StanfordCoreNLP, Yago, DBpedia, WordNet, Gensim, and other modern NLP packages. We have also built a GUI and developed tools to visually tag corpora and visually display results. Our software interfaces with Excel, Gephi, Google Earth, ArcGIS, and can export results in several web and cross-platform friendly formats. I and a handful of other students continue to contribute and address student requests. Additionally, I used many of these tools in my undergraduate thesis research on mining adverse drug effects form online forums.

                I am also in the process of writing a paper with the professor that uses many of these tools. We are looking at the ways authors of different races are written about in New York Times book reviews. A few years ago, someone published a paper that did manual analysis, and we are showing both that we can do all of her analysis automatically and that we can analyze more text and more in-depth analysis using the tools we've developed.

                Through this project, I have learned about and used several modern NLP tools and improved my software development skills. In addition, I have learned about collaboration, debugging, methods of code distribution that make the software accessible to users without a computer science background.
