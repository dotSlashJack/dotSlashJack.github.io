            <h2>Disability Research</h2>
            <p>
                I have worked on several projects and presentations realted to disability language and experiences. I was an invited panel member at the Inclusion Summit hosted by Emory University in 2018 where I spoke about my personal experience as a college student with a disability, as well as my research on disability legislation. 
                Prior to the summit, I used computational linguistics to conduct research on the ways that Federal Legislation portrayed individuals with disabilities over time.
                In 2017, I presented issues related to American transportation and accessibility at the Critical Junctures conference.
            </p>
            <p>
                From these experiences, I learned about new linguistic research tools and how to apply them to information I gathered. I also learned about the experiences of many others with disabilities in the United States. My presentation and communication skills were improved through the submission of an abstract to the Critical Juncture conference and the presentations at the conference and summit.
