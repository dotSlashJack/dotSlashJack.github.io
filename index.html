                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's start with the obvious. I'm Jack, a senior at Emory University finishing a BA in public health and behavioral modeling. My interdisciplinary major has taken me on a journey through the fields healthcare, sociology, biology, linguistics, quantitive sciences, computer science and computational modeling, physics, research and writing, and classical literature.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, much more than this distilled résumé. Let me first describe why I do what I do, because that's most central to who I am. Due to countless surgeries and doctors office visits, I’ve been personally immersed in the healthcare system from the day I was born. I would constantly imagine ways that the healthcare system could be improved, from better equipment to cures for diseases to improved physician-patient interactions. My motivation to improve healthcare—and more fundamentally improve peoples’ quality of life—has been at the core of everything I’ve done. Eventually, I landed in public health in order to work on this goal.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned above, I study and work primarily in public health. Even more fundamentally, I aim to understand people and how they behave so that I can improve foster healthier behaviors at every level of society. On this journey, I’ve gained skills in multiple fields to complement my core field. As a result, I blend technology and behavioral modeling with public health in an effort to better understand how to model the spread of diseases, people, technology, and ideas. By doing so, I strive to create meaningful improvements in behaviors and health outcomes. If you’re curious what kinds of projects I work on, I encourage you to look through the rest of my website [in progress] or <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my undergraduate education, I’ve studied public health from a variety of avenues while working to improve my research and writing skills. More recently, I’ve worked on computational linguistics projects, and am in the process of writing a thesis that bridges healthcare and the drug market with text mining and computer algorithms. Other undergraduate work has involved modeling diseases and people, understanding behavior and social media, and researching how to share and visualize information in a way that can be widely understood. I have also worked for technology and marketing companies where I’ve improved my skills in coding and communicating data.
